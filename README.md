 A collection of Python scripts for analyzing Pokémon datasets using both plain Python and the Pandas library. The scripts include functions for tasks such as calculating descriptive statistics, filtering data, and computing averages based on various attributes of Pokémon. These functions are thoroughly tested using provided datasets and documented for easy understanding and usage.

## Features
Plain Python and Pandas Implementation: Each analysis task is implemented twice, once using plain Python and once using the Pandas library, to demonstrate different approaches.

Thoroughly Tested: All functions are thoroughly tested using provided datasets to ensure correctness and reliability.

Well-Documented: Detailed docstrings are provided for each function, explaining their purpose, input parameters, and expected output.
